		<h1>Climate change: Key UN finding widely misinterpreted</h1>
		
		<div style="color: red">
			<h2>A key finding in the latest IPCC climate report has been widely misinterpreted, according to scientists involved in the study.</h2>
			<p>In the document, researchers wrote that greenhouse gases are projected to peak "at the latest before 2025". This implies that carbon could increase for another three years and the world could still avoid dangerous warming. But scientists say that's incorrect and that emissions need to fall immediately.<p>
